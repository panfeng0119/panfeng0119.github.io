# [Introduction to Hugo Templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/)

Hugo 使用Go语言的 `html/template` and `text/template` 库作为模板.

<br>

# [Content Organization](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/)

Hugo认为相同的结构体用来组织源内容，同样用来渲染站点。

<br>

# Hugo's Lookup Order
Hugo searches for the layout to use for a given page in a well defined order, starting from the most specific.

<br>

# Base Templates and Blocks
The base and block constructs allow you to define the outer shell of your master templates (i.e., the chrome of the page).

<br>

# Install Hugo
Install Hugo on macOS, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and on any machine where the Go compiler tool chain can run.

<br>

# Directory Structure
Hugo’s CLI scaffolds a project directory structure and then takes that single directory and uses it as the input to create a complete website.

<br>

# Code Toggle
Code Toggle tryout and showcase.

<br>

# Configure Hugo
How to configure your Hugo site.

<br>

# Comments
Hugo ships with an internal Disqus template, but this isn’t the only commenting system that will work with your new Hugo website.
