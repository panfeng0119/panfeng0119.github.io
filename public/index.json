Once you are happy with the results:  Press Ctrl+C to kill the server rm -rf public to completely remove the public directory  git submodule add -b master git@github.com:/.github.io.git public. This creates a git submodule. Now when you run the hugo command to build your site to public, the created public directory will have a different remote origin (i.e. hosted GitHub repository). You can automate some of these steps with the following script.  Put it Into a Script You’re almost done. You can also add a deploy.sh script to automate the preceding steps for you. You can also make it executable with chmod +x deploy.sh.\nThe following are the contents of the deploy.sh script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho -e \u0026ldquo;\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub\u0026hellip;\\033[0m\u0026rdquo;\nBuild the project. hugo # if using a theme, replace with hugo -t \u0026lt;YOURTHEME\u0026gt;\nGo To Public folder cd public\nAdd changes to git. git add .\nCommit changes. msg=\u0026ldquo;rebuilding site date\u0026ldquo; if [ $# -eq 1 ] then msg=\u0026ldquo;$1\u0026rdquo; fi git commit -m \u0026ldquo;$msg\u0026rdquo;\nPush source and build repos. git push origin master\nCome Back up to the Project Root cd .. You can then run ./deploy.sh \u0026ldquo;Your optional commit message\u0026rdquo; to send changes to .github.io. Note that you likely will want to commit changes to your  repository as well.\nThat’s it! Your personal page should be up and running at https://.github.io within a couple minutes.\nGitHub Project Pages Make sure your baseURL key-value in your site configuration reflects the full URL of your GitHub pages repository if you’re using the default GH Pages URL (e.g., .github.io//) and not a custom domain.\nDeployment of Project Pages from /docs folder on master branch As described in the GitHub Pages documentation, you can deploy from a folder called docs/ on your master branch. To effectively use this feature with Hugo, you need to change the Hugo publish directory in your site’s config.toml and config.yaml, respectively:\npublishDir = \u0026ldquo;docs\u0026rdquo; publishDir: docs After running hugo, push your master branch to the remote repository and choose the docs/ folder as the website source of your repo. Do the following from within your GitHub project:\nGo to Settings → GitHub Pages From Source, select “master branch /docs folder”. If the option isn’t enabled, you likely do not have a docs/ folder in the root of your project. The docs/ option is the simplest approach but requires you set a publish directory in your site configuration. You cannot currently configure GitHub pages to publish from another directory on master, and not everyone prefers the output site live concomitantly with source files in version control.\nDeployment of Project Pages From Your gh-pages branch You can also tell GitHub pages to treat your master branch as the published site or point to a separate gh-pages branch. The latter approach is a bit more complex but has some advantages:\nIt keeps your source and generated website in different branches and therefore maintains version control history for both. Unlike the preceding docs/ option, it uses the default public folder. Preparations for gh-pages Branch These steps only need to be done once. Replace upstream with the name of your remote; e.g., origin:\nAdd the public Folder First, add the public folder to your .gitignore file at the project root so that the directory is ignored on the master branch:\necho \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore Initialize Your gh-pages Branch You can now initialize your gh-pages branch as an empty orphan branch:\ngit checkout \u0026ndash;orphan gh-pages git reset \u0026ndash;hard git commit \u0026ndash;allow-empty -m \u0026ldquo;Initializing gh-pages branch\u0026rdquo; git push upstream gh-pages git checkout master Build and Deployment Now check out the gh-pages branch into your public folder using git’s worktree feature. Essentially, the worktree allows you to have multiple branches of the same local repository to be checked out in different directories:\nrm -rf public git worktree add -B gh-pages public upstream/gh-pages Regenerate the site using the hugo command and commit the generated files on the gh-pages branch:\ncommit-gh-pages-files.sh\nhugo cd public \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add \u0026ndash;all \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026ldquo;Publishing to gh-pages\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd .. If the changes in your local gh-pages branch look alright, push them to the remote repo:\ngit push upstream gh-pages Set gh-pages as Your Publish Branch In order to use your gh-pages branch as your publishing branch, you’ll need to configure the repository within the GitHub UI. This will likely happen automatically once GitHub realizes you’ve created this branch. You can also set the branch manually from within your GitHub project:\nGo to Settings → GitHub Pages From Source, select “gh-pages branch” and then Save. If the option isn’t enabled, you likely have not created the branch yet OR you have not pushed the branch from your local machine to the hosted repository on GitHub. After a short while, you’ll see the updated contents on your GitHub Pages site.\nPut it Into a Script To automate these steps, you can create a script with the following contents:\npublish_to_ghpages.sh\n#!/bin/sh\nDIR=$(dirname \u0026ldquo;$0\u0026rdquo;)\ncd $DIR/..\nif [[ $(git status -s) ]] then echo \u0026ldquo;The working directory is dirty. Please commit any pending changes.\u0026rdquo; exit 1; fi\necho \u0026ldquo;Deleting old publication\u0026rdquo; rm -rf public mkdir public git worktree prune rm -rf .git/worktrees/public/\necho \u0026ldquo;Checking out gh-pages branch into public\u0026rdquo; git worktree add -B gh-pages public upstream/gh-pages\necho \u0026ldquo;Removing existing files\u0026rdquo; rm -rf public/*\necho \u0026ldquo;Generating site\u0026rdquo; hugo\necho \u0026ldquo;Updating gh-pages branch\u0026rdquo; cd public \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add \u0026ndash;all \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026ldquo;Publishing to gh-pages (publish.sh)\u0026rdquo; This will abort if there are pending changes in the working directory and also makes sure that all previously existing output files are removed. Adjust the script to taste, e.g. to include the final push to the remote repository if you don’t need to take a look at the gh-pages branch before pushing. Or adding echo yourdomainname.com \u0026gt;\u0026gt; CNAME if you set up for your gh-pages to use customize domain.\nDeployment of Project Pages from Your master Branch To use master as your publishing branch, you’ll need your rendered website to live at the root of the GitHub repository. Steps should be similar to that of the gh-pages branch, with the exception that you will create your GitHub repository with the public directory as the root. Note that this does not provide the same benefits of the gh-pages branch in keeping your source and output in separate, but version controlled, branches within the same repo.\nYou will also need to set master as your publishable branch from within the GitHub UI:\nGo to Settings → GitHub Pages From Source, select “master branch” and then Save. Use a Custom Domain If you’d like to use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, create a file static/CNAME. Your custom domain name should be the only contents inside CNAME. Since it’s inside static, the published site will contain the CNAME file at the root of the published site, which is a requirements of GitHub Pages.\nRefer to the official documentation for custom domains for further information.\n","date":1461081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515772800,"objectID":"bd5e347cc44a9a7c5552986e9b450f2e","permalink":"panfeng0119.github.io/post/%E6%89%98%E7%AE%A1%E5%9C%A8github/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"panfeng0119.github.io/post/%E6%89%98%E7%AE%A1%E5%9C%A8github/","section":"post","summary":"Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"将 Hugo 站点托管在 GitHub","type":"post"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536739986,"objectID":"5cec0ce6e082b377c504bc66cdf990c5","permalink":"panfeng0119.github.io/publication/person-re-identification/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"panfeng0119.github.io/publication/person-re-identification/","section":"publication","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors.

By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.
